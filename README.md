# Visual Analytics Final Project
This is the Final Project for the Visual analytics class. This project is for Crypto currency, the first taste of virtual money, available to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We're in the unregulated, risky, experimental phase with more than 10,000 different digital currencies available globally with minimal government rules or oversight and very few people are buying stuff with it yet. 

This project is focusing on top 7 crypto currency market analysis, the daily changes and a deep diving into the daily fluctuation in terms of opening and closing price.
